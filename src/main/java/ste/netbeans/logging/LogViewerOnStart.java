/**
 * Initializes and attaches the custom {@link LogViewerHandler} to the root logger
 * when the NetBeans module is started.
 * <p>
 * This class is automatically invoked by the NetBeans platform during module initialization
 * via the {@link OnStart} annotation. By registering the {@code LogViewerHandler} with the root
 * java.util.logging logger, we enable integration between the standard Java logging framework and
 * a dedicated NetBeans UI component (typically {@code LogViewerTopComponent}), making log records
 * available to the user interface for real-time viewing, filtering, or further processing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We can customize log handling across the entire application by changing the handler registered
 * here. Typically, this setup is only required once per application lifecycle, and no manual
 * invocation is necessary â€” the NetBeans runtime handles triggering the {@code run()} method at
 * module startup.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example usage scenario:
 *   - Start the NetBeans-based application.
 *   - As soon as this module is activated, the root logger will forward log records to the
 *     {@code LogViewerHandler}, which routes them to the visual log viewer component.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <strong>Threading:</strong>
 * <p>
 * This method is called by NetBeans infrastructure, so we do not need to handle threading concerns.
 * </p>
